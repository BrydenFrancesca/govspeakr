# What is govspeakr?
govspeakr is an R package that is designed to help users to develop
[Reproproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP)](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/events/introduction-to-reproducible-analytical-pipelines-rap-2/).
Specifically, it enables the user to convert R markdown files to [govspeak markdown](http://govspeak-preview.herokuapp.com/guide),
which can be directly uploaded to the Whitehall publisher ([gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk)).
